# AESRevShell
AESRevShell is a secure reverse shell tool that utilizes AES encryption (CBC mode) to ensure encrypted communication between a client and a server. This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful way to establish a secure command execution environment, where commands issued by the server are securely transmitted to the client and executed, with responses being sent back in an encrypted format.

### Key features:
- **AES encryption (CBC mode)** for secure data transmission.
- **Client-server architecture** for reverse shell functionality.
- **Key and IV validation** to ensure both parties use the correct encryption parameters.
- **Command execution:** The server sends commands to the client, which are executed and returned securely.

This project is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate how AES encryption can be used in real-time communication for security testing and penetration testing scenarios.
